# Emotion_Recognition

# Vehicle Identification

# Project Description

This repository contains Python code for a CNN based Facial Expression Recognition solution.

# Dataset Used

## FER13 Dataset

The Kaggle Emotion and Facial Expression Recognition challenge training dataset consists of
28,709 images, each of which are 48Ã—48 grayscale images. The faces have been
automatically aligned such that they are approximately the same size in each image. Given these
images, our goal is to categorize the emotion expressed on each face into seven distinct classes:
angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral
